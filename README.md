# Overview
A comparison between GCP's Cloud Foundation Toolkit and the core GCP Terraform provider. 

Through the use of the `google` terraform provider we are able to create resources in GCP via the base `resource` abstractions. 

Google have released a series of opinionated terraform modules under the Cloud Foundation Toolkit (CFT). It is a series of Terraform reference templates which reflect Google's best practices. This comes in the form of 45 terraform modules which are open source and available at the following locations:
- https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-toolkit/blob/master/docs/terraform.md
- https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest


# Google Cloud Platform Terraform Provider
Terraform provides the concept of a Provider which is a way to configure your GCP infrastructure. It is through the definition of this provider resource that we get access to all GCP resource representations.

There exists today two google providers. The baseline is the `google` provider however if access to new and early features are made available through the `google-beta` provider:
- google
- google-beta

The Google provider is required irrespective of whether baseline terraform or Cloud Foundation Toolkit modules are used. 

The following is an example of a provider block that should be included in the root terraform module:
```
provider "google" { 
project = "my-project-id"
region = "australia-southeast1" 
}
```

# Baseline Terraform Resources
With the Google Provider in-place we can now move on with the definition of GCP resources. For example the following defines a simple Cloud Storage bucket with a minimalist configuration:

```
resource "google_storage_bucket" "auto-expire" { 
    name = "auto-expiring-bucket" 
        location = "US" 
        force_destroy = true 
        lifecycle_rule { 
            condition { 
                age = 3 
            } 
            action { 
                type = "Delete" 
            } 
        } 
}
```

These resources are the base abstraction over GCP resources themselves. In order to combine similar resources into a common pattern for the purposes of re-usability we need to define a module. 

A module is a container for multiple resources that are used together. It is a mechanism for the team to create lightweight abstractions so that they can describe the infrastructure in terms of its architecture, rather than directly in terms of physical objects.

# Cloud Foundation Toolkit Terraform Resources
As with the use of baseline resource objects once we have defined the google provider weâ€™re ready to get started defining GCP resources. We touched on the concept of modules in the previous section and as described in the Overview this is how we consume CFT.

Here is an example of a Cloud Storage bucket created via the CFT module:
```
module "bucket" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/cloud-storage/google//modules/simple_bucket"
  version = "~> 1.3"

  name       = "example-bucket"
  project_id = "example-project"
  location   = "us-east1"
  iam_members = [{
    role   = "roles/storage.objectViewer"
    member = "user:example-user@example.com"
  }]
}
```

Something to consider here is that this is a module whose source is a remote location which maps to the Terraform Registry:
- https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/cloud-storage/google/latest/submodules/simple_bucket

The inclusion of the `iam_members` attribute is important here as it signifies the advantage of using this module. Using base resources in GCP would require separate objects to define the permissions model. This module provides a mechanism to specify at the same time as bucket creation. This enables teams to provision resources much faster. 

Also, these are versioned and where applicable provide backwards compability to older version of Terraform.
